ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This repository documents practical cybersecurity tasks performed in a lab environment, demonstrating end-to-end security operations from detection to response. Each module represents real-world scenarios using industry-standard open-source tools.

1 Threat Hunting with PowerShell Detection
Objective: Detect suspicious PowerShell activity using Sigma rules and Elastic Security

Key Activities:

Created Sigma rule for encoded PowerShell command detection

Ingested Windows logs into Elastic Security

Executed threat hunting queries for Event ID 4688

Documented findings in structured format

2. Malware Analysis Fundamentals
Objective: Analyze benign samples using static and dynamic analysis techniques

Key Activities:

Static analysis with strings and peframe in REMnux

Dynamic analysis via Hybrid Analysis

Comparative analysis report

IOC identification and documentation

3. Vulnerability Management Pipeline
Objective: Build automated vulnerability scanning and management workflow

Key Activities:

OpenVAS scanning of Metasploitable2 VM

Results import into DefectDojo

Vulnerability prioritization using CVSS scores

Remediation planning and mitigation strategies

4. Incident Response Simulation
Objective: Simulate and respond to phishing attacks using modern IR tools
